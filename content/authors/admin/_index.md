I am a PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the LAMSADE, a joint laboratory of Université Paris-Dauphine. I have worked for a year on Adversarial Attacks on Invertible Neural Networks and generated with Invertible Neural Networks. For now, my research interest are focused on a wider scope : Invertible Neural Network structures. I am working on the theoretical and experimental learning abilities of INNs and more specifically Normalizing Flows.
