I am currently a PhD candidate at LAMSADE, a joint research lab of Université Paris-Dauphine and Université PSL, specializing in Machine Learning. My initial research was centered around Adversarial Attacks generated using Invertible Neural Networks. Recently, I have expanded my research interests to delve into the expressivity of generative models. My current work involves both theoretical and experimental exploration of the learning abilities of discriminator-based generative models, specifically examining diversity and sample quality. I have successfully developed GANs and Normalizing Flows, striking a balance between Recall and Precision, tailored to user-specific requirements
