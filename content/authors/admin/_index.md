I am currently a Research Fellow at CSD at ENS PSL, specializing in Generative Models. I defended my PhD in July 2024 at Université Paris-Dauphine under the supervision of Prof. Yann Chevaleyre. My research was centered around the expressivity of Generative Models and the trade-off between the quality and the diversity of the generated data. By properly choosing the divergence that models are trained to minimize, the overall behavior can be set in advance, and thus I have worked on tuning and improving models such as Normalizing Flows, Generative Adversarial Networks or Diffusion Models.

I am currently looking for interns at Université Paris Dauphine to work on Diffusion Models: {{<icon name="download" pack="fas">}} {{< staticref "uploads/topic.pdf" "newtab" >}}offer{{< /staticref >}}.
